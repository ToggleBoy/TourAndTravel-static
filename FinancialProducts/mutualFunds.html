              A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle consisting of a
              portfolio of stocks, bonds or other asset classes. Mutual funds
              give small or individual investors access to diversified,
              professionally managed portfolios at a low price. Mutual funds are
              divided into several kinds of categories , representing the kinds
              of securities they invest in, their investment objectives, and the
              type of returns they seek. Facts that you must know before
              investing in mutual fund:

                  >Mutual Fund is not necessarily all about equity or
                  stocks.</span
                ><br />
                Mutual funds also deal into debt instruments like Certificate of
                Deposits (CDs), Bonds, Govt. Securities (G-Sec.),
                Non-convertible Debentures (NCDs) etc. This means that a mutual
                fund scheme can also have all or some of these debt instruments
                in its portfolio. MF schemes that are having debt papers of very
                small duration are least risky. Similarly, carefully chosen debt
                MF schemes can be as safe as fixed deposits along with better
                tax-adjusted return. Contact MF Distributor and start investing
                in equity, debt, hybrid or multi asset allocation schemes as per

                ><br />

                    Through Systematic Investment Plans ( SIP ) you can invest a
                    fixed amount at regular intervals for any number of years.
                    This way your investments will reap the benefit of rupee
                    cost averaging i.e. buying more units when price is low and
                    buying lesser units when price is high.

                  <li class="mb-2">
                    If you need regular withdrawals from your Mutual Fund
                    investment, then Systematic Withdrawal Plan ( SWP ) is the
                    best option. Here a fixed amount (set by you) will be
                    automatically withdrawn for preset number of years.
                    Depending on the fund available and withdrawal amount, this
                    will continue.

                  <li class="mb-2">
                    If you are concerned about short term volatility while
                    making a lump sum investment, then go for Systematic
                    Transfer Plan ( STP ). Here, the lump sum money will be
                    first invested in a liquid scheme (low risk debt fund) and
                    then from there, a fixed amount will be transferred to a
                    chosen equity scheme of the same fund house. This way,
                    exposure in equity scheme will be made on a staggered basis
                    and hence risk is minimized in case of volatile market
                    movements.

                  >How are your Mutual Fund investments taxed? </span
                ><br />
                If in portfolio of a MF scheme, percentage of exposure into
                equity type of instruments is more than or equal to 65%, then
                such schemes are known as equity schemes, otherwise those would
                be considered as debt schemes for taxation purpose. Equity
                schemes and debt schemes are taxed differently. Taxing also
                depends on how long you hold the investment before you sell. If
                gain from equity scheme is booked before 1 year is completed
                then such gain would be taxed at flat 15% rate. If equity
                schemes are sold after holding for more than a year – then 10%
                tax is to be paid on gain made over and above Rs. 1 lakh. If
                debt schemes are held for more than three years then 20% tax is
                to be paid on indexed (i.e. inflation adjusted) capital gain. If
                investments in debt schemes are held for shorter-term then tax
                is to be paid on booked gain amount as per one’s tax slab.
